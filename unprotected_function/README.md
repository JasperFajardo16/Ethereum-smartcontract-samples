# Unprotected function
Missing (or incorrectly used) modifier on a function allows an attacker to use sensitive functionality in the contract.

## Attack Scenario

A contract with a `changeOwner` function does not label it as `private` and therefore
allows anyone to become the contract owner.

## Mitigations

Always specify a modifier for functions.

## Examples
- An `onlyOwner` modifier is [defined but not used](Unprotected.sol), allowing anyone to become the `owner`
